# Chatbot_RAG
The chatbot is built using a Retrieve-Answer-Generate (RAG) framework, leveraging advanced tools like Hugging Face, LLaMA, and Pinecone to deliver contextually relevant and accurate responses. This system is designed to retrieve information from a vectorized database and generate coherent answers based on user queries.
