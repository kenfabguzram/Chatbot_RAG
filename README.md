# **Chatbot RAG**

The chatbot utilizes a *Retrieve-Answer-Generate (RAG)* framework, combining tools like Hugging Face, LLaMA, and Pinecone to deliver contextually relevant and accurate responses. This system efficiently retrieves information from a vector database and generates coherent answers based on user queries.

## **1. Data Retrieval with Pinecone**
Pinecone serves as the vector database, enabling efficient similarity searches. A pre-trained model from the SentenceTransformers library, such as `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, is used to generate embeddings for documents in the dataset. These embeddings are stored and indexed in Pinecone.  
When a user submits a query:
- The query is encoded into an embedding.
- Pinecone retrieves the most relevant context by comparing the query embedding with the stored vectors.

## **2. Answer Generation with LLaMA**
The LLaMA 2 (7B) model is employed for generating responses. Integrated via Hugging Face, this model is designed to produce coherent and informative answers.  
- The retrieved context from Pinecone and the userâ€™s query are combined into a prompt.  
- The LLaMA model processes the prompt and generates a response that merges the retrieved information with its language understanding capabilities.

## **3. System Workflow**
1. The user inputs a query.  
2. The query is converted into an embedding using SentenceTransformers.  
3. The embedding is sent to Pinecone, which retrieves the most relevant document or context.  
4. The retrieved context and the query are passed as a prompt to the LLaMA model.  
5. The model generates and returns a response to the user.

## **4. Key Features**
- **Efficiency**: Pinecone ensures fast retrieval of relevant contexts, enabling real-time interactions.  
- **Accuracy**: Semantic embeddings and LLaMA's generative capabilities provide accurate, context-aware responses.  
- **Scalability**: The modular RAG framework is suitable for large datasets and adaptable to various domains.  
- **Open-Source Tools**: Leveraging LLaMA and Hugging Face ensures a cost-effective solution, ideal for academic or research projects.
